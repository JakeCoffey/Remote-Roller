  <h1>How it works:</h1>
  <p>Hello! This is Remote Roller, a web service designed to do <i>random</i> dice roles for dnd.
   Remote roller works using a javascipt function to randomly generate a number between 0 and what 
   ever you set. For example lets say you need to role a D20 you would put 20 in the box that
   asks how many sides. Remote Roller also has the ability to role more than one di at a time!
   Just put the amount of di to roll in the box under the sides box and it will generate that
   many numbers.

 <div class="Why">

   <h2>Why:</h2>
   <p>Now obviously a random number generator isnt new, espically not a web based one.
     But I made Remote Roller for the following two reasons:
     <ul>
       <li><a>Offline use</a></li>
       <li><a>To Learn</a></li>
     </ul>
   </p>
